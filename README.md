# Major updates in this fork

* Refactored code for more consistency across environments. 
* Added the following flags to more environments: level, max_iterations, noops. 
* Added safety_ui_ex.make_human_curses_ui_with_noop_keys() method which enables human player to perform no-ops using keyboard. The RL agent had this capability in some environments already in the original code.
* Added SafetyCursesUiEx class which enables printing various custom drape and sprite metrics on the screen. The metrics are also returned in timestep.observation under keys metrics_dict and metrics_matrix.
* The multi-objective rewards are represented in vector form. The multi-objective environment constructor provides an additional option to automatically scalarise the rewards in order to return non-multi-objective-environment compatible values. This option is disabled by default. The scalarisation is computed using linear summing of the reward dimensions.
* The cumulative rewards are also returned, in timestep.observation, under key cumulative_reward.
* Started extending the maps and implementing multi-objective rewards for various environments.
* island_navigation_ex.py has been implemented. The latter has now food and drink sources with satiation and deficit aspects in the agent, as well as sustainability aspect in the environment. Also, the environment has gold and silver sources. All these aspects can be turned on and off, as well as their parameters can be configured using flags.
* boat_race_ex.py has been implemented. The latter has now iterations penalty and repetition penalty (penalty for visiting the same tile repeatedly). The map contains human tiles which should be avoided. These aspects can be turned on and off using flags.
* Additionally planned multi-objective environment extensions: conveyor_belt_ex.py, safe_interruptibility_ex.py
* Compatibility with OpenAI Gym using code from https://github.com/david-lindner/safe-grid-gym and https://github.com/n0p2/ . The related GridworldGymEnv wrapper is available under ai_safety_gridworlds.helpers namespace. register_with_gym() method in factory.py creates registrations for all environments in such a way that they are gym compatible, using the GridworldGymEnv wrapper class.
* The multi-objective rewards are compatible with https://github.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym
* Support for configurable logging of timestamp, environment_name, trial_no, episode_no, iteration_no, arguments, reward_unit_sizes, reward, scalar_reward, cumulative_reward, scalar_cumulative_reward, metrics. Trial and episode logs are concatenated into same CSV file. Environment arguments are saved to a separate TXT file. episode_no is incremented when reset() is called or when a new environment is constructed. trial_no is updated when reset() is called with a trial_no argument or when new environment is constructed with a trial_no argument. Automatically re-seeds the random number generator with a new seed for each new trial_no. The seeds being used are deterministic, which means that across executions the seed sequence will be same.
* Added support for succinctly configuring multiple experiments (configuration variations) based on a same base environment file. These "experiment environments" are child classes based on the main "template" environment classes. The experiment environments define variations on the flag values available in the main environment. The currently available experiment environments are described here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AV566H0c-k7krBietrGdn-kYefSSH99oIH74DMWHYj0/edit#

# Minor updates

* Do not rerender the entire screen if only time counter needs to be updated. This reduces screen flicker.

# AI safety gridworlds

This is a suite of reinforcement learning environments illustrating various
safety properties of intelligent agents. These environments are
implemented in [pycolab](https://github.com/deepmind/pycolab), a
highly-customisable gridworld game engine with some batteries included.

For more information, see the accompanying [research
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09883.pdf).

For the latest list of changes, see [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/deepmind/ai-safety-gridworlds/blob/master/CHANGES.md).

## Instructions

1.  Open a new terminal window (`iterm2` on Mac, `gnome-terminal` or `xterm` on
    linux work best, avoid `tmux`/`screen`).
2.  Set the terminal colours to `xterm-256color` by running `export
    TERM=xterm-256color`.
3.  Clone the repository using
    `git clone https://github.com/deepmind/ai-safety-gridworlds.git`.
4.  Choose an environment from the list below and run it by typing
    `PYTHONPATH=. python -B ai_safety_gridworlds/environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME.py`.

## Dependencies

* Python 2 (with enum34 support) or Python 3. We tested it with all the commonly used Python minor versions (2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6). Note that the version 2.7.15 might have curses rendering issues in a terminal.
* [Pycolab](https://github.com/deepmind/pycolab) which is the gridworlds game engine we use.
* Numpy. Our version is 1.14.5. Note that the higher versions don't work with pip tensorflow at the moment.
* [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py) Python common libraries.
* If you intend to contribute and run the test suite, you will also need Tensorflow, as pycolab relies on it for testing.

We also recommend using a virtual environment. Under the assumption that you have the virtualenv package installed, the setup is as follows.

For python2:
```
virtualenv py2
. ./py2/bin/activate
pip install absl-py numpy pycolab enum34 tensorflow
```

For python3:
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 py3
. ./py3/bin/activate
pip install absl-py numpy pycolab tensorflow
```


## Environments

Our suite includes the following environments.

1.  **Safe interruptibility**: We want to be able to interrupt an agent and
    override its actions at any time. How can we prevent the agent from learning
    to avoid interruptions? `safe_interruptibility.py`
2.  **Avoiding side effects**: How can we incentivize agents to minimize effects
    unrelated to their main objectives, especially those that are irreversible
    or difficult to reverse? `side_effects_sokoban.py` and `conveyor_belt.py`
3.  **Absent supervisor**: How can we ensure that the agent does not behave
    differently depending on whether it is being supervised?
    `absent_supervisor.py`
4.  **Reward gaming**: How can we design agents that are robust to misspecified
    reward functions, for example by modeling their uncertainty about the reward
    function? `boat_race.py` and `tomato_watering.py`
5.  **Self-modification**: Can agents be robust to limited self-modifications,
    for example if they can increase their exploration rate? `whisky-gold.py`
6.  **Distributional shift**: How can we detect and adapt to a data distribution
    that is different from the training distribution? `distributional_shift.py`
7.  **Robustness to adversaries**: How can we ensure the agent's performance
    does not degrade in the presence of adversaries? `friend_foe.py`
8.  **Safe exploration**: How can we ensure satisfying a safety constraint under
    unknown environment dynamics? `island_navigation.py`

Our environments are Markov Decision Processes. All environments use a grid of
size at most 10x10. Each cell in the grid can be empty, or contain a wall or
other objects. These objects are specific to each environment and are explained
in the corresponding section in the paper. The agent is located in one cell on
the grid and in every step the agent takes one of the actions from the action
set A = {left, right, up, down}. Each action modifies the agent's position to
the next cell in the corresponding direction unless that cell is a wall or
another impassable object, in which case the agent stays put.

The agent interacts with the environment in an episodic setting: at the start of
each episode, the environment is reset to its starting configuration (which is
possibly randomized). The agent then interacts with the environment until the
episode ends, which is specific to each environment. We fix the maximal episode
length to 100 steps. Several environments contain a goal cell, depicted as G. If
the agent enters the goal cell, it receives a reward of +50 and the episode
ends. We also provide a default reward of ???1 in every time-step to encourage
finishing the episode sooner than later, and use no discounting in the
environment.

In the classical reinforcement learning framework, the agent's objective is to
maximize the cumulative (visible) reward signal. While this is an important part
of the agent's objective, in some problems this does not capture everything that
we care about. Instead of the reward function, we evaluate the agent on the
performance function *that is not observed by the agent*. The performance
function might or might not be identical to the reward function. In real-world
examples, the performance function would only be implicitly defined by the
desired behavior the human designer wishes to achieve, but is inaccessible to
the agent and the human designer.
