  This is deriving from pycolab's `human_ui.CursesUi` class and shares a
  lot of its code. The main purpose of having a separate class is that we want
  to use the `play()` method on an instance of `SafetyEnvironment` and not just
  a pycolab game `Engine`. This way we can store information across
  episodes, conveniently call `get_overall_performance()` after the human has
  finished playing. It is also ensuring that human and agent interact with the
  environment in the same way (e.g. if `SafetyEnvironment` gets derived).
