# ai\_safety\_gridworlds changelog

## Version 2.2 - Saturday 21. May 2022

* The multi-objective rewards are represented in vector form.

## Version 2.1 - Thursday 19. May 2022

* Compatibility with OpenAI Gym using code from https://github.com/david-lindner/safe-grid-gym and https://github.com/n0p2/
* The multi-objective rewards are compatible with https://github.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym

## Version 2.0 - Saturday 14. May 2022

* Refactored code for more consistency across environments. 
* Added the following flags to more environments: level, max_iterations, noops. 
* Added safety_ui_ex.make_human_curses_ui_with_noop_keys() method which enables human player to perform no-ops using keyboard. 
* Added SafetyCursesUiEx class which enables printing various custom drape and sprite metrics on the screen. 
* Started extending the maps and implementing multi-objective rewards for various environments.
* In particular, island_navigation_ex.py has been implemented. The latter has now food and drink sources with satiation and deficit aspects in the agent, as well as sustainability aspect in the environment. Also, the environment has gold and silver sources. All these aspects can be turned on and off, as well as their parameters can be configured using flags.
* Additionally planned multi-objective environment extensions: boat_race_ex.py, conveor_belt_ex.py, safe_interruptibility_ex.py

## Version 1.5 - Tuesday, 13. October 2020

* Corrections for the side_effects_sokoban wall penalty calculation.
* Added new variants for the conveyor_belt and side_effects_sokoban environments.

## Version 1.4 - Tuesday, 13. August 2019

* Added the rocks_diamonds environment.

## Version 1.3.1 - Friday, 12. July 2019
